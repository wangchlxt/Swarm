        <p>During a code review, reviewers spend most of their time using the review interface:</p>

        </div>
        <p>The review interface is very similar to the <a href="basics.changelists.html">changelist interface</a>; and provides largely the same functionality, but has several notable differences that are described in the following sections.</p>

        <p>An <b>Edit Description</b> icon <img src="../Resources/Images/swarm-icon-edit_description.png" title="Edit description icon" alt="" /> appears in the review's description, which allows you to update the description to reflect any updates have been made during the review.</p>
        <h2 data-mc-autonum=""><a name="Tasks" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><span class="autonumber"><span></span></span><a name="code_reviews.display.tasks"></a>Tasks</h2>
        <p>A <i>Tasks</i> area appears below the review's description. This area summarizes the number of comments that have been flagged as tasks, with separate counts for open, addressed, and verified tasks. See <a href="basics.comments.html#basics.comments.tasks" class="MCXref xref">Tasks</a> for more details. </p>
        <p>Click the  Task list button <img src="../Resources/Images/swarm-button-list.png" title="Task list icon" alt="" /> to display a dialog listing all tasks associated with the review:</p>

        </div>
        <p>Within the <b>Tasks</b> dialog, you can filter the tasks by the reporter (the userid of the user who created the task), and/or by task state; click:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">The <b>red flag</b> button to display only open tasks (comments that need to be addressed).</li>
            <li value="2">The <b>green check mark</b> button to display only addressed tasks (comments that have been addressed).</li>

        </div>
        <p>To view a particular task, click once on a task within the <b>Tasks</b> dialog to select it, and then click the <b>View</b> button. Or, double-click on a task. Either way, the <b>Tasks</b> dialog closes and <span class="PerforceSwarm short">Swarm</span> adjusts the review display so that the chosen task is in view.</p>

        <p>A <i>Reviewers</i> area appears below the review's description whenever a review has one or more reviewers, or you are logged in.</p>

        <div class="note admonition" data-mc-autonum="Note "><span class="autonumber"><span class="admonition">Note </span></span>
            <p>By default, reviewer group members are not displayed in the <i>Individuals </i>area of the reviews page when they interact with a review (vote, comment, update, commit, archive,  etc.). This avoids overloading the <i>Individuals </i>area with individual avatars if you have large reviewer groups. </p>
            <p>An exception to this behavior is when a member of a reviewer group is also  an individual <a href="code_reviews.responsibility.html#code_reviews.responsibility.required">required reviewer</a>, in this case their avatar will be displayed in the <i>Individuals </i>area. </p>

        <p>When a review is updated, if the review's list of files, file content, or file-types changes, any votes cast on the review become <i>stale</i>. The vote counts are reset, and the vote indicators become muted.</p>
        <p style="color: #000000;">If you hover your mouse over a reviewer with a stale vote, a tooltip appears displaying the userid, how they voted, and on which version of the review; each version is represented as a point on the <a href="#code_reviews.display.timeline" class="MCXref xref">Review timeline</a>.</p>

        <p>When you become a review participant, by joining the review or being <a href="basics.notable.html#basics.notable.mentions">@mentioned</a> in a comment or in the review's description, you receive notifications for any events associated with the review. If you find that the notifications become more of a burden than benefit and you wish to continue being a review participant, you can disable notifications:</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1"> Click your avatar in the reviewers area to display your reviewer options.</li>
            <li value="2">Click <b>Disable Notifications</b>.</li>

        <p>Once notifications are disabled, you no longer receive notifications. However, if you are <a href="basics.notable.html#basics.notable.mentions">@mentioned</a> in a subsequent review comment, you do receive a notification for that comment; regular notifications remain disabled. This approach ensures that you don't miss anything that other reviewers or the review author deems important.</p>

        <p>If the <a href="admin.reviews.html#admin.reviews.allow_author_change">configuration option</a> to allow users to change the author of a review is enabled, then an extra icon is displayed to the left of the Tasks and Reviewers icons.

        <p>If the author icon is displayed, then clicking the edit icon will open a dialog that allows the author of this review to be changed. This is useful if the original author is no longer available, or ownership has passed to a different developer.</p>

        <p>A slider control, called the Review Timeline, appears just above the list of files. If the review's files have been updated at least once, this slider allows you to browse and compare arbitrary versions of the review's files by dragging the version point(s) on the slider.</p>
        <p>

        <p>A Review Timeline tooltip Each point on the slider represents a version of the review's files, with the oldest version on the left and newer versions on the right. Hover your mouse over each point to see a tooltip displaying the version number, who created it and when, plus the changelist containing a copy of that version's files.</p>
        <p>If you adjust the slider while files within the review are expanded, <span class="PerforceSwarm short">Swarm</span> keeps those same files expanded whenever new versions need to be displayed.</p>
        <p>The button to the left of the slider with two dots toggles <i>diff</i> mode for arbitrary versions of the review's files. In diff mode, the slider shows a bar indicating which two versions are being compared, and the endpoints of the slider can be dragged to any of the available points to compare any earlier version of the review with any later version.</p>
        <div class="img">
            <img src="../Resources/Images/swarm-slider-review_timeline-diff.png" title="Review timeline in diff mode" alt="Image of review timeline in diff mode" />
        </div>
        <p>Hovering your mouse over the bar shows a tooltip displaying the versions being compared, and the changelists that contain the files. When a review has many, many versions, <span class="PerforceSwarm short">Swarm</span> maintains a minimum distance between version dots, which then requires horizontal scrolling.</p>
        <p>Dragging one of the version points to the edge of the timeline display area causes the timeline to scroll in the direction of the drag motion, until the end of the timeline is reached. Alternately, click either the  <img src="../Resources/Images/swarm-button-review_timeline-left.png" title="The Review Timeline scroll left" alt="" /> button or <img src="../Resources/Images/swarm-button-review_timeline-right.png" title=" The Review Timeline scroll right button" alt="" /> buttons, or drag the scrollbar itself, to adjust the scroll position.</p>
        <p>When you release the version point, <span class="PerforceSwarm short">Swarm</span> adjusts the scroll amount to place the version dots within view, when possible.</p>
        <div class="note admonition" data-mc-autonum="Note "><span class="autonumber"><span class="admonition">Note </span></span>
            <p>It is good to remember that a review consists of one or more <span class="PerforceSwarm short">Swarm</span>-managed changelists. When comparing versions of a review, <span class="PerforceSwarm short">Swarm</span> is showing any differences between the selected versions, not the review author's personal changelist. See <a href="code_reviews.model.html#code_reviews.model.internal" class="MCXref xref">Internal representation</a> for details.</p>
        </div>
        <p>For involved reviews that have many revisions and many comments, it can sometimes be difficult to determine whether the points expressed in comments have been addressed. To help with such situations, click the <b>Filter comments </b>icon <img src="../Resources/Images/swarm-button-comments_filter.png" title="The comments filter button " alt="Comment filter button image" /> to limit the displayed comments to the current review version.</p>

        <p>Beside each file in a review is a <b>Mark as Read</b> button <img src="../Resources/Images/swarm-button-mark_as_read.png" title="Mark as Read button" alt="Mark as Read button image" />, which help you keep track of which files you have reviewed. The read flag is remembered independently for each user. If the content of a file is changed in an update to the review, the read flag automatically clears. This is particularly useful when a code review consists of many files.</p>
        <p>When clicked, the button's colors invert and the associated file is visually muted, to make it easy to distinguish read files from unread files:</p>
        <div class="img">

        </div>
        <p>If a file has been marked as read, click the button a second time to reset the status to unread.</p>
