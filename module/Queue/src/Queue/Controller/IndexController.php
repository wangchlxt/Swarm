     * Workers process tasks in the queue.
     *
     * The role of a worker is very simple. It grabs the oldest task from the
     * queue and triggers an event for the task. Each event has two params:
     * id and time. The name of the event is task.type (e.g. task.change or
     * or task.change). The event manager and listeners handle the rest.
     *
     * Immediately after processing a task, the worker attempts to grab another
     * task. If there are no task in the queue, the worker will sleep for
     * a second and then try again (unless the retire flag is set in which case
     * the worker will shutdown). When the worker's running time exceeds the
     * worker lifetime setting, it exits (to avoid potential memory leakage).
     * However, any given task can run as long as it wants and consume as much
     * memory as is available (to accommodate large changes for instance).
     *
     * Workers run in the background by default (they hang-up immediately).
     * You can pass a 'debug' query parameter to prevent the worker from
     * closing the connection. When run in this mode, the worker will write
     * its log output to the client (in addition to the log file).
     *
     * @triggers worker.startup
     *           When a worker first starts up
     * @triggers task.<type>
     *           When a <type> task is processed (e.g. task.change)
     * @see Queue\Manager for more details.
     * @todo consider setting p4 service to p4_admin and clearing user identity info.
