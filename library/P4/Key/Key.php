/**
 * Abstracts operations against Perforce keys.
 * We just extend the counter abstract, tweak the type and implement a set
 * and a delete method which don't accept the force parameter.
 *
 * This class is somewhat unique as calling set will immediately write the new value
 * to perforce; no separate save step is required.
 * When reading values out we do attempt to use cached results, to ensure you read
 * out the value directly from perforce set $force to true when calling get.
